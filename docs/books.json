        "review": "It's amazing how good a book on philosophy can be to read. After this book I finally recognized the fact that I have been an existentialist since childhood. In fact, I think Chinese people who have gone through atheism and post-modernization, as long as they are not staunch Marxists, all of them have more or less existentialist thoughts. But I still retain doubts. Existentialism still cannot calm me. For I have no religious fervor or desire for the will to power. The fear of death and the paradox of the value of life cannot be removed by my existentialism.",

        "review": "Feynman is the man who discovered the true nature of science. Science should be played out, and it should be more fun than utilitarian. A scientist, we should resist the mystification, falsification, monopoly of knowledge behavior, away from the discovery of the fun of science will degenerate into a bureaucratic utilitarian things. Feynman's smooth sailing is really due to his integration of fun in learning, integration of thinking in life. So I think that in some places, like Brazil in the book, it is impossible to develop real science without a political, cultural and social context. The scientific endeavor in these places is developed at the expense of human happiness and the idea of freedom. When science becomes an instrument of the State, it is a disaster for the nation.",

        "review": "I suddenly thought that 'disease' itself is a very special term. Disease is not a tangible entity; it is different from pathogens and symptoms, and it does not belong to the body. It is the cause of the state of being unhealthy. According to normal word formation logic, people would first name this state and then name the cause. For example, the state of being ill could be called 'non-health,' so disease should be called 'non-health cause.' However, people first refer to it as disease and then call the state of being ill, which indicates that the term 'disease' holds significant meaning for people.\nMoreover, when people say they have recovered from an illness, there is also a logical contradiction, because recovering health should logically be called 'the illness has worsened.' This makes one feel that disease itself is an extremely ambiguous existence; it exists between the metaphysical and the physical, it is both self and enemy, arising from life yet oriented towards death. The term itself inevitably carries metaphorical implications. Susan Sontag said that the worst metaphor for disease is the military metaphor, which is very interesting in connection with today's article by Qin Hui.",

For example, read his power law respectively point of view to realize that the childhood was indoctrinated in the historical determinism of the wrong, the prisoner's dilemma extrapolated from the dilemma of pacifism is a very good thinking tool. The taper is the last few chapters, and social psychology should be Pinker's home turf now.

There are many questions that science has not yet been able to answer, but that doesn't mean we have to stop thinking about them and wait for a scientific answer to come along that is absolutely right. For example, how to think about death, or what kind of lifestyle to choose. The book says that a way of thinking from the heart, meditation, can enhance our experience of life and is largely corroborated by science. It's a revelation to me that in these moments of uncertainty and grayness, there are ways to find inner peace in the pursuit of truth.",
